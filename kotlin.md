``` kotlin
class ScanActivity : BaseActivity(), IScanView.Proxy { 
```
# Explaining Class Inheritance Implementation
In this code snippet, `ScanActivity` is a class that extends (inherits from) `BaseActivity` and implements the `IScanView.Proxy` interface.

The `extends` keyword is used to indicate that the `ScanActivity` class is a subclass of `BaseActivity`, which means that it will inherit all the properties and methods of the `BaseActivity` class.

The `implements` keyword is used to indicate that the `ScanActivity` class will implement the methods specified in the `IScanView.Proxy` interface. An interface is a group of related methods with empty bodies, which a class must implement. By implementing an interface, a class agrees to implement all of the methods defined in the interface.

It is also worth noting that `BaseActivity` and `IScanView.Proxy` are both types that are defined elsewhere in the code.

Encapsulation:

Encapsulation is the process of wrapping up data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, or object. Here is an example of encapsulation in Kotlin:

``` kotlin
Copy codeclass BankAccount {
    private var balance: Double = 0.0  // data is encapsulated within the class

    fun deposit(amount: Double) {  // method that operates on the data
        balance += amount
    }

    fun getBalance(): Double {  // method that operates on the data
        return balance
    }
}

```

In this example, the `balance` variable is private and can only be accessed within the `BankAccount` class. The `deposit` and `getBalance` methods provide a way to modify and access the value of `balance`, respectively. This allows the implementation details of the `BankAccount` class to be hidden from other classes, which promotes encapsulation.

Inheritance:

Inheritance is the process of creating a new class that is a modified version of an existing class. The new class is called the subclass, and the existing class is the superclass. Here is an example of inheritance in Kotlin:

``` kotlin
Copy codeopen class Vehicle(val make: String, val model: String) {
    open fun startEngine() {  // open method can be overridden by subclasses
        println("Engine started.")
    }
}

class Car(make: String, model: String, val year: Int) : Vehicle(make, model) {
    override fun startEngine() {  // override the startEngine method from the superclass
        println("Car engine started.")
    }
}

class Truck(make: String, model: String, val payload: Double) : Vehicle(make, model) {
    override fun startEngine() {  // override the startEngine method from the superclass
        println("Truck engine started.")
    }
}

```

In this example, the `Vehicle` class is the superclass, and the `Car` and `Truck` classes are subclasses that inherit from it. The `Car` and `Truck` classes override the `startEngine` method from the `Vehicle` class to provide their own implementation.

Polymorphism:

Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. In Kotlin, polymorphism is often achieved through inheritance and method overriding. Here is an example of polymorphism in Kotlin:

``` kotlin
Copy codeopen class Vehicle(val make: String, val model: String) {
    open fun startEngine() {  // open method can be overridden by subclasses
        println("Engine started.")
    }
}

class Car(make: String, model: String, val year: Int) : Vehicle(make, model) {
    override fun startEngine() {  // override the startEngine method from the superclass
        println("Car engine started.")
    }
}

class Truck(make: String, model: String, val payload: Double) : Vehicle(make, model) {
    override fun startEngine() {  // override the startEngine method from the superclass
        println("Truck engine started.")
    }
}

fun main() {
    val vehicles = arrayOf(Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2020), Truck("Ford", "F-150
```

Abstraction:

Abstraction is the process of exposing only the essential characteristics and behavior of an object, while hiding the implementation details. In Kotlin, abstraction can be achieved through the use of abstract classes and methods. Here is an example of abstraction in Kotlin:

```kotlin
Copy codeabstract class Shape {  // abstract class cannot be instantiated
    abstract fun getArea(): Double  // abstract method must be overridden by concrete subclasses

    fun getPerimeter(): Double {  // non-abstract method can have a default implementation
        return 0.0
    }
}

class Circle(val radius: Double) : Shape() {
    override fun getArea(): Double {  // override the abstract getArea method
        return Math.PI * radius * radius
    }

    override fun getPerimeter(): Double {  // override the getPerimeter method from the superclass
        return 2 * Math.PI * radius
    }
}

class Rectangle(val width: Double, val height: Double) : Shape() {
    override fun getArea(): Double {  // override the abstract getArea method
        return width * height
    }
}

```

In this example, the `Shape` class is an abstract class that cannot be instantiated. It has one abstract method (`getArea`) and one non-abstract method (`getPerimeter`) with a default implementation. The `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes are concrete subclasses of the `Shape` class that must override the abstract `getArea` method. The `Circle` class also chooses to override the `getPerimeter` method from the `Shape` class, while the `Rectangle` class uses the default implementation.

This allows the `Shape` class to provide a common interface for calculating the area and perimeter of different shapes, while hiding the implementation details of how those calculations are performed.
