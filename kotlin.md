``` kotlin
class ScanActivity : BaseActivity(), IScanView.Proxy { 
```
# Explaining Class Inheritance Implementation
In this code snippet, `ScanActivity` is a class that extends (inherits from) `BaseActivity` and implements the `IScanView.Proxy` interface.

The `extends` keyword is used to indicate that the `ScanActivity` class is a subclass of `BaseActivity`, which means that it will inherit all the properties and methods of the `BaseActivity` class.

The `implements` keyword is used to indicate that the `ScanActivity` class will implement the methods specified in the `IScanView.Proxy` interface. An interface is a group of related methods with empty bodies, which a class must implement. By implementing an interface, a class agrees to implement all of the methods defined in the interface.

It is also worth noting that `BaseActivity` and `IScanView.Proxy` are both types that are defined elsewhere in the code.
