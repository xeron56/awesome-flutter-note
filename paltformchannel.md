# what is method channel how to use ith in flutter
To call Java code from Flutter, you can use a `MethodChannel`. A `MethodChannel` is a way for Flutter code to communicate with platform-specific code in the host platform.

To set up a `MethodChannel`, you will need to create a `MethodChannel` in your Flutter code and a corresponding method in your Java code. You can then call methods on the `MethodChannel` from your Flutter code, and the Java code can respond by calling a callback provided by the Flutter code.

Here's an example of how you can set up a `MethodChannel` and call a method on it from Flutter:

```java
Copy code// In your Flutter code
final MethodChannel methodChannel = MethodChannel('your_channel_name');

// Call a method on the MethodChannel
final String result = await methodChannel.invokeMethod('your_method_name', yourMethodArgs);

// The result of the method call is returned to the Flutter code
print(result);

```

To handle the method call in your Java code, you will need to create a `MethodCallHandler` and register it with the `MethodChannel`. The `MethodCallHandler` will be called when the Flutter code calls a method on the `MethodChannel`.

Here's an example of how you can set up a `MethodCallHandler` in your Java code:

```java
Copy code// In your Java code
MethodChannel.Result result;

MethodChannel methodChannel = new MethodChannel(getFlutterView(), "your_channel_name");
methodChannel.setMethodCallHandler(new MethodChannel.MethodCallHandler() {
  @Override
  public void onMethodCall(MethodCall call, MethodChannel.Result result) {
    if (call.method.equals("your_method_name")) {
      // Handle the method call
      String resultString = yourMethodImplementation(call.arguments);
      result.success(resultString);
    } else {
      result.notImplemented();
    }
  }
});

```

You can pass any arguments you want from the Flutter code to the Java code as the `arguments` parameter in the `invokeMethod` call. The Java code can then access these arguments and use them in the method implementation.

To pass data back from the Java code to the Flutter code, you can use the `success` or `error` method of the `Result` object. The Flutter code will receive the data passed to these methods as the result of the `invokeMethod` call.
